Using celery 5.1.2 you can get the task id by the following code snippet:


```python
from celery import current_app as celery_app

# in your function:
celery_app.tasks['task_dosomething'].AsyncResult('task_id')


```


Where task\_dosomething is the name of your task and task\_id is the id you choose. You can learn more about setting task id [here](https://www.pythonkitchen.com/how-to-set-task-id-in-celery/)

Works on windows 8
