The [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/) documentation about deplyments are super vague. This post explains how to add deployments.

#### Where are deployment codes located in the docs

Deployments are not located inside the Deployment section, but rather in the [flows section](https://docs.prefect.io/latest/concepts/flows/).

#### What is a Deployment

Typically, deployments, whererver you define them, populate a class like this which you don't need to write:

```py
class Deployment:
    """
    Structure of the schema defining a deployment
    """

    # required defining data
    name: str 
    flow_id: UUID
    entrypoint: str
    path: str = None

    # workflow scheduling and parametrization
    parameters: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
    parameter_openapi_schema: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
    schedules: list[Schedule] = None
    paused: bool = False
    trigger: Trigger = None

    # metadata for bookkeeping
    version: str = None
    description: str = None
    tags: list = None

    # worker-specific fields
    work_pool_name: str = None
    work_queue_name: str = None
    infra_overrides: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
    pull_steps: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
```

Deployments are essentially defining metadata

#### Define and run prefect deployments

Deployments can be created like this. where `hello_world` is a flow

```py
hello_world.serve(name="my-first-deployment",
                      tags=["onboarding"],
                      parameters={"goodbye": True},# flow params
                      interval=60)
```
You can run the deployment like this

```py
from prefect.deployments import run_deployment
run_deployment(name="hello_world/my-first-deployment")
```

Or, you can run on the commandline

```shell
prefect deployment run 'hello_world/my-first-deployment'
```

### A minimal example

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect import task

@task
def laugh():
	pass

@task
def run():
	pass

@task
def swim():
	pass

@task
def walk():
	pass

@flow
def first_subflow():
	laugh()
	run()

@flow
def second_subflow():
	laugh()
	run()

@flow
def pipeline():
    # do stuffs
    first_subflow()
    second_subflow()




if __name__ == "__main__":
    pipeline.serve(name="ml-pipeline")
```

Then on the shell we run

```shell
prefect deployment run 'pipeline/ml-pipeline'
```

It will produce something like this

```
Creating flow run for deployment 'pipeline/canon-pipeline'...
Created flow run 'beautiful-nyala'.

```

#### The prefect server

If you go to the prefect server you can see:

![Selection_383](https://github.com/pythonkitchen/pythonkitchen/assets/22630684/4ab235d6-6b54-48f0-b019-69cfbebe3cdb)

You can click on the toggle to activate then press the run button or select interval, which can also be defined when serving
