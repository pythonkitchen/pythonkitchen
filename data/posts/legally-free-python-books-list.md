- Author: Muhammad Yasoob Ullah Khalid
- Why It’s Valuable:
Python is an amazing language with a strong and friendly community of programmers. However, there is a lack of documentation on what to learn after getting the basics of Python down your throat. Through this book I aim to solve this problem. I would give you bits of information about some interesting topics which you can further explore. The topics which are discussed in this book open up your mind towards some nice corners of Python language. This book is an outcome of my desire to have something like this when I was beginning to learn Python. If you are a beginner, intermediate or even an advanced programmer there is something for you in this book. Please note that this book is not a tutorial and does not teach you Python. The topics are not explained in depth, instead only the minimum required information is given. A true example of legally free Python books.

## Boxes: Your Second Python Book

- Level: Beginner
- Focus: Introductory Materials
- Author: Roberto Alcina
- Why It’s Valuable:
This book tries to achieve only one thing: Show you a project go from **nothing** to **OK**. By nothing I mean, no code at all. Not even a fleshed idea of what it does. No goals, no commitments. Just a vague interest. And by OK I mean it will work, it will have tests, it will be available to use, it will be **useful** and be a real thing. Think of it as a sort of documentary on the beginnings of a rock band, only instead of rockers there is a single overweight Argentinian dev, and instead of a band there is a piece of software. So, not much like a documentary on the beginnings of a rock band.

## Learn Python, Break Python

- Level: Beginner
- Focus: Introductory Materials
- Author: Scott Grant
- Why It’s Valuable:
Learn Python, Break Python is a hands-on introduction to the Python programming language, written for people who have no experience with programming whatsoever. Hey, we all have to start somewhere. As such, the examples and teaching style used in this text make absolutely no expectations about your prior programming experience. Anyone can pick up the art of programming with a little time and a bit of patience. However, when learning something new, I try to break things. In fact, in many cases, I go out of my way to break stuff. When picking up a new concept like computer programming, you can actually increase your comfort level by figuring out the type of cases that are likely to break. You'll see what data can be used and where, and when you inevitably run into errors later (like everyone does), you won't be surprised.

## Slither Into Python

- Level: Beginner
- Focus: Introductory Materials
- Author: Unknown
- Why It’s Valuable:
Slither into Python is an introduction to Python for complete beginners. No prior programming experience or computer science background is necessary. Unlike any other Python resources I have found (not that they're not out there), they don't explain important computer science concepts such as memory or "how computers work". In this book I will cover the fundamentals of the Python language and also introduce these important concepts. Put simply, *coding* or *computer programming* is about making computers do what you want, Computer Science is about *how* computers do it. Each go hand-in-hand, help you learn faster and improve your overall understanding of a language! This book aims to do exactly that through Python.

## Python for Astronomers

- Level: Beginner
- Focus: Introductory Materials
- Author: Imad Pasha, Christopher Agostino
- Why It’s Valuable:
This text is designed to be an introduction to the Python programming language — which is now used nearly ubiquitously in astronomy — with applications to the types of tasks an undergraduate (or beginning graduate student) might have to tackle. It is not, in any way, meant to be comprehensive; my focus is on bringing you up to speed as efficiently and quickly as possible. This text might have useful information for those with a working knowledge of Python outside of a research setting, but is primarily designed for those with no prior programming experience. By the end of this text, I hope to have shared enough to make you feel comfortable taking the first steps into research-type problems (of which this book will contain several examples), whether in an astronomy course, a research internship, or on-campus research.

## Create a Simple Flask Application with Cloud9, Heroku and MongoDB

- Level: Varies
- Focus: Web
- Author: Douglas Starnes
- Why It’s Valuable:
One of the biggest hurdles to learning a new framework, language or tool is the prerequisite setup and configuration that needs to take place.  This can be a frustrating and discouraging experience.  Also, the cost associated with doing often makes experimentation prohibitive or at least restricted.  That is why in this short book, I have chosen tools and services that require little or no setup, and are all free.  In fact, none of them require any installation because they all run in the browser.  Throughout the enitire book, you'll never have to leave the web browser.

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

### Are these books really free and legal?
Yes. Every book in this list is either released under a Creative Commons license, made free by the author on their website, or offered as a legal "free tier" by publishers like No Starch Press or Manning.

### Which book should I start with as a complete beginner?
We recommend **Think Python** for a computer science approach, or **Automate the Boring Stuff** if you want to see immediate practical results in your daily work.

### Do I need to know math to learn Python?
Most Python tasks (web dev, automation, scripting) require only basic logic. Specialized fields like Machine Learning or Data Science do require a grasp of statistics and linear algebra, but many of the books listed here (like *Think Bayes*) teach the math through code.

### Is Python 2 still relevant?
No. All resources in this list focus on **Python 3**. Python 2 reached its end-of-life in 2020 and should no longer be used for new projects or learning.
