Linux owners configure makefiles so as to have easy commands to perform operations such as `make dependencies` to pip install required packages. Here are the dry simple steps to run makefiles in Python projects on Windows.

1. Download [git for windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win). You should get git bash, git gui etc
2. Download the [mingw GUI setup](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get-setup.exe/download). Install it wherever you want. After running the setup you should get a screen like that:

3. On continuing you should get under **all packages**. Search for make, class bin. Right click and select mark for installation

4. Under installation, select apply changes

5. Confirm by clicking on apply

6. My git for windows' migw is installed at `C:\Program Files\Git\mingw32` and my mingw get is installed at `C:\MinGW`. We need to merge the contents on the mingw32 folder with the MinGW. Ctrl+a to select all folder in MinGW then right click and copy. Then go to mingw32 folder and click paste. When asking is merge, say yes. If same files skip



- Verify if there is `venv/` in project gitignore. If not add it and reapply gitignore by using the following command [(see accepted answer)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19663093/apply-gitignore-on-an-existing-repository-already-tracking-large-number-of-file)

- create a new virtual environent.



```python
python -m venv venv

```

9. activate the env



```python
cd venv
cd scripts
. activate

```

note the space between . and activate

10. cd back `cd ../..`



now try out any command listed [here](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas-blog) for example `make dependencies`

Forgot to say under bin rename `mingw-get.exe` to `make.exe`

Anything mail me <arj.python at gmail dot com>
