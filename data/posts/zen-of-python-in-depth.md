Note: *I wrote a quite complete article on the Zen but for some reason it went down in seo history. I am tired seeing people write 'in-depth' article with commentaries from the top of their head and materials they pulled out of their pockets. I'm publishing the article in here. The commentary part is built from the sayings of Brett Cannon, Guido, Chris Angelico, Nick Coghlan, Raymond Hettinger & co. Warning: read only if you are a fan of Python. Last notes: I do hope learners will get a great glimpse of how the Zen can help them structure their code and give them better insight and foresight. It's a documentation of how practically the Zen is applied in Python decisions.*

* Authentic Commentary



The Zen of Python saw light for the first time in 1999. It's one of the many aspects that adds to the awesomeness of Python. It's a set of expressions which corners the spirit of the language. It was enounced by Tim Peters, a reputable software engineer, master Pythonista and Python's 'most prolific and tenacious core developer' in the words of none other than Guido [18]. This article bases itself mostly on the saying of core devs and highly reputable members. It makes a great gift to all those interested in the history of the sysadmin script which took the world by (pleasent) surprise.

Birth of the Path
=================



The way the Zen came about was unique. It was a reflection from the unknown Patrick Phalen about the Python feel [1]:


> 
>  ... the more I use
>  and learn about the language, the more I find myself appreciating the
>  nice balance and heft Guido gave to it. Yet there doesn't seem to be a
>  single document that sums up that "aesthetic," but rather it
>  tends to appear piecemeal, over time, mostly in the Wisdom of Chairman Tim.
> 



It was a call to infuse the Python spirit into aliens from Perl Land and beyond. It requested some 10 to 20 lines which sums up the Python view


> 
>  Would both Guido and TIm Peters be willing to collaborate on a short
>  paper -- call it "The Python Way" for lack of a better title -- which
>  sets out the 10-20 prescriptives they might offer to those who come to
>  Python from other languages and immediately want to find a way to bend
>  it into uncomfortable positions -- (implement closures, etc.).
> 



It was a request to prevent Pythonistas from falling into the error of campaigning for changing the language. It advocated for imbuing yourself with the language's flow and change your ways and views instead of the other way round. In the original mail, it quoted Fredrik Lundh as saying "sure looks like the 'community' thinks that changing the
language is more important that using it..." [5]. Patrick clarifies:


> 
>  What I have in mind is sort of a very brief Strunk-&-White-like
>  "Elements of Style" for Python, which suggests fundamental idiomatic
>  recommendations for operating within the spirit of the language. A
>  distillation of Python Zen is what I'm talking about -- something to go
>  off and contemplate when the "fix Python now" decibels become a bit
>  much.

Zen, Strunk and White
=====================



The Zen school lays out hints and guidelines. You understand by your own exercise and by the company of someone seasoned in the craft


> 
>  it de-emphasizes mere knowledge of sutras and doctrine and favors direct understanding through spiritual practice and interaction with an accomplished teacher or Master.[2]
> 



The Zen was a request to help Python people achieve the Python state of mind so that your code resonates well with the structure behind, conveying in the process the associated beauty, elegance and finesse. Those guidelines if well impregnated would make your code revered whithin the circle of true monks.

But, curiously enough, Tim tells [19]:


> 
>  If I were to change anything, I'd drop the reference to "Zen". That wasn't
>  part of the original, and was added by someone else.
> 



In other words, the title is not from the author [23]

Strunk & White is the name of two people, viz William Strunk and Elwyn Brooks White. Strunk wrote *The Elements of Style*, acclaimed by the Times as one of the most influencial books since 1923 [3]. White who was Strunk's student and reviser after the professor's death describes the book as:


> 
>  a forty-three page summation of the case
>  for cleanliness, accuracy, and brevity in the use of English [4]
> 



The effect of the book is described below, he being Strunk:


> 
>  he omitted so
>  many needless words, and omitted them so forcibly and with such eagerness and obvious
>  relish, that he often seemed in the position of having shortchanged himself â€” a man left
>  with nothing more to say yet with time to fill, a radio prophet who had out-distanced the
>  clock. Will Strunk got out of this predicament by a simple trick: he uttered every sentence
>  three times
> 



One effect of applying the Zen would then also be lighter code files.

Master Tim Showers his Blessings
================================



Master Tim heard the plea, approved the demand and responded accordingly [6]


> 
>  Clearly a job for Guido alone -- although I doubt it's one he'll take on
>  (fwiw, I wish he would too!). Here's the outline he would start from,
>  though :
> 



```python
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

```


The 20th was left for Guido to fill in:


> 
>  There you go: 20 Pythonic Fec^H^H^HTheses on the nose, counting the one I'm
>  leaving for Guido to fill in.
> 



Venerable Tim shares exactly how the lines came about [15]:


> 
>  It was a throwaway python-list post. But like all great triumphs of literature, it was written during commercials breaks while watching professional wrestling on TV, and munching on a ham sandwich. All true!
> 



Yet, the author is emphatical: It's complete and more than meets the demand [6]:


> 
>  If the answer to *any* Python design issue
>  isn't obvious after reading those -- well, I just give up .
> 



The above also reveals the purpose of the Zen: To address design issues. And it's not a simple matter. Guido says [18]:


> 
>  In many ways, the design philosophy I used when creating Python is probably one of the main reasons for its ultimate success.
> 



The Zen only gives the outlines, in contrast to Strunk and White which gives explanations and examples in addition. Thus the need for commentaries. These help the non-initiated without being a replacement for the company of the bright minds.

In a time of fluctuating and steered standards, the reference in the actual PEP8 document to Strunk and White in the usage of the English language caused a bitter, ugly and messy thread [7]. It caused some of the best people of the community to forego following python-list [8], a casual reminder that being too open without limit hurts.

Reality of the Zen
==================



The Zen has become an important piece of the Python programming language. If you don't know the Zen, you won't strike the right chord to communicate with the community. Raymond Hettinger advises:


> 
>  Before creating more tracker items, please take time to learn about how Python's history, how it is used, and its cultural norms. In particular, read the Zen of Python, consider what is meant by duck-typing, what is meant by "a consenting adults language", what is meant by over-specification, etc. Python is quite different from Java in this regard. [13]
> 



There's also a practical aspect to it. It's popular because it works [14]. It's the golden guiding principle in pretty much everything Python.

Finally are the Zen points rules? What are they really. Many people take the Zen for rules. The 'most opinionated linter ever' at one time actually included the Zen to back their views [9]. It was situations like these which prompted me to write: The Zen Of Python Is A Joke And Here Is Why [10]. It was nice enough for Michael Kennedy and Brian Okken to call it a 'must read' on PythonBytes [11].

According to Nick Coghlan, the Zen gives you the idea, not everything [12]:


> 
>  This
>  challenge is reflected in the fact that the Zen of Python is
>  deliberately self-contradictory, as it articulates competing design
>  principles to take into consideration, rather than being able to
>  provide ironclad rules that avoid the need for human judgement in
>  determining which of those design guidelines are most salient in any
>  given situation.
> 



Self contradiction is also coincidentally, one of the criticised aspect of Strunk and White [17].
The Zen also goes beyond coding, such as shaping the thought pattern of features [12]:


> 
>  The thing we work toward as core developers, and aspiring core
>  developers, is good design intuition that aligns with the Zen of
>  Python. That doesn't mean we're all going to be able to perfectly
>  articulate that intuition in every case, and even when we can, those
>  explanations are themselves generally going to be backed by intuition
>  rather than rigorous scientific research.
> 



If ever i myself would have added a 20th one it would have been: "Use your judgement.". But Nick illustrated it better.

As for the famous `import this` command, it was Barry Warsaw's pick. He sneaked it in a this.py in 2001 along with the ROT13 obfuscation [16]. He also mentionned that it was a time 'when the Python community had a sense of humor'.

Authentic Commentary
====================



Now the time is ripe to see what the Zen actually means. But before we should know that whatever the words
and concepts mean in the Zen is not necessarily applicable elsewhere [20].

### Beautiful is better than ugly.



Beautiful and ugly in this context has nothing to do with human appearance. It's in the same general sense as in other technical fields: there's beautiful & ugly physics, beautiful & ugly mathematics, beautiful & ugly computer code [19]. Beauty in design is very similar to beauty in flora. For it refers to a general feeling of consistency, pureness and standing out on its own. It's abstract and doesn't have anything to do with humans [20]. This line can be replaced by 'Elegant is better than inelegant.' to understand it better [21]. The 'beauty' line is one of multiple contrasts, and should be judged in that context, not in isolation [22]. At heart, Python's design emerged from Guido's sense of beauty [23]

### Explicit is better than implicit.



> 
>  The Zen of Python points out that "explicit is better than implicit" for a reason: ambiguity and implicit knowledge that is not easily communicated code is easy to get wrong and leads to bugs. By forcing developers to explicitly separate out their binary data and textual data it leads to better code that has less of a chance to have a certain class of bug.
> 



Brett Cannon [25]


> 
>  It's been interesting seeing how ppl interpret "explicit is better than implicit" to say specifying 'object' is good. For me, syntactically leaving out a base class **is** explicit, not as *verbose*, and is more visually identifiable

Raymond Hettinger [39]

### Complex is better than complicated.



oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com gives both complex and complicated as synonyms with meaning:
"made of many different things or parts that are connected; difficult to understand"

dictionary.cambridge.org gives complex as: "having many parts connected in ways that are difficult to understand" and complicated as: "confusing or difficult to understand"

macmillandictionary.com defines complex as: "something that is complex has a lot of details or small parts that make it difficult to understand or deal with" and complicated as: "difficult to do, deal with, or understand, especially because of involving a lot of different processes or aspects" and 2. "made up of many different but connected parts"

merriam-webster.com gives complex as: a whole made up of complicated or interrelated parts and composed of two or more parts, complicated as: consisting of parts intricately combined and difficult to analyze, understand, or explain

We can translate the line to mean:


> 
>  A solution which is made up of different interconnected parts is better than one which is difficult to analyze, understand, or explain
> 



or


> 
>  A complex solution is better than a more complex one
> 



or


> 
>  A solution which is made up of different interconnected parts is better than one which has many parts but is difficult to analyze, understand, or explain
> 


### Flat is better than nested.



Nesting constructs like conditionals or functions or classes or modules one inside the other too much is frowned upon. The x.y.z.q.w.w example is given as the author of the lib nested too many modules one inside the other, given a tiring usage experience

### Sparse is better than dense.

### Readability counts.

Chris Angelico [34]

The motto of Python is clarity. The language attempts to be as readable as the english language. Guido says [18]:


> 
>  Iâ€™d like to mention one readability rule specifically: punctuation characters should be used conservatively, in line with their common use in written English or high-school algebra.

### Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.

### Errors should never pass silently.


### Unless explicitly silenced.



> 
>  Thus, in Python 2.3, we abandoned my home-grown 2.2 MRO algorithm in favor of the academically vetted C3 algorithm. One outcome of this is that Python will now reject any inheritance hierarchy that has an inconsistent ordering of base classes. For instance, in the previous example, there is an ordering conflict between class X and Y. For class X, there is a rule that says class A should be checked before class B. However, for class Y, the rule says that class B should be checked before A. In isolation, this discrepancy is fine, but if X and Y are ever combined together in the same inheritance hierarchy for another class (such as in the definition of class Z), that class will be rejected by the C3 algorithm. This, of course, matches the Zen of Python's "errors should never pass silently" rule.

Mariatta Wijaya [36]

It should be noted that the dashes here don't play a role as it's Tim's way of emphasis. And it is to be noted that Brett missed it on his blog. He was maybe writing from memory.

Al Sweigart [43]

The Koans offered the programming world a great legacy. It is an interesting sight to see from Go to JavaScript devs analysing their own langs in the light of the Zen.
