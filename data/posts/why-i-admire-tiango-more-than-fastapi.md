People talk about FastAPI a lot, but they give little attention to Sebastián Ramírez, alias tiangolo. It's so obvious to me that FastAPI is a reflection of someone cool. It's hard to miss the fact that FastAPI is cool but it has lots of details that shine beyond technical ones.

If you take a look at commit messages, they are awesome! I mean it's great and this was what first tipped me that Tiangolo is not your next door dev, I intend to use that in my projects soon as it is very sleeeek.

Yes, the docs has an [official page](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/fastapi-people/) dedicated to the community. It has also most active users, contributors and reviewers. It also has sponsors but having a special thoughts for contributors is stellar level

Aesthetics

Using the docs system above, the docs look pretty neat

For even something as basic as installing a lib, you have a cli animation for it. This from experience makes onboarding very very very easy!

So

Sleek is what i would define the whole thing, way of doing and writing. The owner has an eye for design and aesthetics
