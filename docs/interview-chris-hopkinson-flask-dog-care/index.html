                        <p>Chris has been learning Flask to help with Dog Care. He felt Flask would help him in his business activities! Let&rsquo;s have a chat with him!</p>
<p>Welcome Chris Hopkinson,</p>
<h3>Can you present yourself, your business?</h3>
<p>While I have a background in computing, programming, and web development, I have been away from the scene for almost ten years. In that time, I pursued a business degree and started a successful dog daycare company alongside my brother. COVID has affected us a great deal, but pre-COVID, we had around 60 active customers who used our service at least once per week.</p>
<p>The current COVID situation led me to rethink my future, and I&rsquo;m now refocussing on computing. I will take my passion for coaching and channel it into teaching computer science at UK High Schools this September.</p>
<p>In the UK, computer science is taught in all secondary schools (ages 11-16) and the programming language of choice tends to be Python. My transition to Python began at the start of January, and I have loved learning and developing small projects over these past few months.</p>
<p>However, I quickly realised I needed a new project to sink my teeth in to – so that I could learn, apply those skills, and level up.</p>
<p>For this project, I chose something that I knew a lot about – something that I knew, from experience, would be of use. I learn best by working through projects and solving problems as I come across them. Flask seemed like a great framework to suit my style, as I was able to start putting together ideas and sections of the project quickly and without spending much time setting things up.</p>
<h3>Why did you learn Flask, how was the experience?</h3>
<p>As touched upon above, I learned Flask to improve my Python skills in practical applications of the language. There&rsquo;s a wealth of documentation, Stack Overflow questions, and YouTube videos to lean on for my development. I also joined a small group of people learning Flask on Discord – which led to more inspiration, motivation and lots of great conversations.</p>
<h3>Tell us a bit about your ongoing Flask project for your business. What challenges did you face?</h3>
<p>For the past four years, my business has been using Google Sheets/Excel for diary and customer management – which worked okay for the most part. But there was user error to contend with, and customers communicating with us day and night – which takes up a lot of time. In the beginning, when we had fewer customers, it wasn&rsquo;t such an issue. But as our customer base grew and more enquiries came in, it became time-consuming and created a lot of stress for my brother and me.</p>
<p>There are existing software or web app options available for businesses in our category. Though, any customer management or booking system I&rsquo;ve looked at in the past has either been too difficult to use or just not right for the way our business works with unnecessary features and complicated dashboards.</p>
<p>My project solves these problems by delivering:</p>
<ul>
<li>A web-based platform that customers access directly; managing their bookings and reducing workload for staff/business owners.</li>
<li>Simple views for both customers and staff/owners that are easy to use.</li>
<li>A solution that is tailored to small businesses that don&rsquo;t need complicated dashboards.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made something for us from scratch, and I&rsquo;m really happy with how it&rsquo;s turning out – it&rsquo;ll save the business both time and money going forward, and streamline operations as the business scales.</p>
