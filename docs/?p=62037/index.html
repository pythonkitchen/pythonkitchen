<p>What is enlightenment</p>
<p>win manager, X 11, unriesizeable looks broken https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System
used unix uni
atmega person</p>
<p>win manager as that time
couldnt cutomise
discovered people released source code
learnt c, tinkering by own, by product of OS course, failed C, right after this started win man
rxvt
most c codes written than peers</p>
<p>not put efforts in things not interested in</p>
<p>Advices to learn C</p>
<p>give reason to learn and apply, dont learn for the the sake of learning, accomplish a task, get good in mechanism used to get ttask done, set goal, make sure task within task/reach, plod along and get done. will drive desire and actual learning, motivation.</p>
<p>why uni res all over place? in graphics top marks, others no. manual pages on x functions. read all of them. desire to customise, your insane, nobody write win man from scratch. advice: get the backbone, persevere, dont listen to people. said people dont want, wrong people wanted that. 
win man on low key pc perform better. people see screenshot of enlightment -&gt; want that. after 6 month see interest.</p>
<p>hack FLWM change borders etc from &lsquo;devil gray&rsquo;. amazed. screenshots -&gt; emails you have source code, open source was not a concept then. put code up, enlightment. put out not for fame etc, nowadays some people concerned with popular, users etc but hinder innovation as aways copying around</p>
<p>asking for features pr, decide whats important for community for me what to work on?</p>
<p>whats is important to me. influcenced by what imp to com. big amount of w to make few people happy. enlightment shouldnt be popular even if it got many users. dont lose soul in the process. dont trade it for people happiness. turn on features if need. balance out. dont want to lose reason to live.</p>
<p>any changes open source run started until now?</p>
<p>early days: self service, users devs, send patches
in few decades sense of entitlement, people think entitled to free stuff, dont add that i wont use your stuff. very disappointed, side effect of open source -&gt; pushing for free. since i dont put in effort, i get what i get but no. emotional blackmail, -&gt; if popular goal: users blackmail, make people happy. Vastly diff from exterprise. You need to make money, OS is not that.</p>
<p>how balance popularity driven by company paying and your goals</p>
<p>driven by comp but not absolute necessity. made mistakes, adopt conservative approach. comp send engs, send patches, get angry if patches dont get merged. go about making prs without consultation. sometimes bad reasoning. sometimes people dont know project want to solve their way. conservative instead of making people happy. moulding conv to produce better. like C vs C++ discussion, same if right libs/stacks.</p>
<p>what seperates a good from a great soft eng?</p>
<p>attitude, simple attidtue care, balance trees etc good but learnable when needed. attitude matters, i care make things good. good code is care also, important thing in enlightment, doent crash. recovery mechanism. end user. 1.2 M lines of code in efl enlightment 280 000 lines. good pratise: alll exceptions should assert when wrong and exit. etc. but good as long as not eating own dog food. what if you were working on something and everything just disappeared? recovery in face of own mistake care for end user. care enough to use what you write. make robust for you, catch your own bugs before end user. coverity static analyser, free for open source. enlightment only 3 issues. best codes: 1 per 1000 lines, 0.4 for linux kernel, efl 0.2, elightment 0.01. quality measurement of caring. careful about warnings though, sometimes wrong. if not care, find a reason to care or drop.</p>
