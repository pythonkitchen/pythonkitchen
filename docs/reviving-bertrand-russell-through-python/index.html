                        <p>famous authors are praised, respected, admired and missed due to their works. after reading all the titles of an excellent author, one is left wishing for more. curiously enough we now have the ability to produce more books that fit in the literary style, depth and topic tackling techniques of writers. perfection in this field opens a new era, you might hear of ~~mouse~~ cat trap by darwin, russian trip by mark twain and god beyond doubt by hawkins.</p>
<h2>markov?</h2>
<p>markov chains are probabilistic pattern generating models. &lsquo;patterns&rsquo; can be events, text or geometrical arrangements</p>
<p>let us take the example of a person going to a fast food outlet where there are only three types of foods, rounder, burger and panini.</p>
<p>the probability of him taking a rounder after already taking one is 0.2 or 2/10</p>
<p>after a rounder, the probability of taking a burger is 0.4 or 4/10</p>
<p>after a rounder, the probability of taking a panini is 0.4 or 4/10</p>
<p>notice that there are three arrows going out for three choices, which when added make up 1</p>
<ul>
<li><img alt="" src="https://www.pythonmembers.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/markov.png" /></li>
</ul>
<p>let us make up the remaining part for burger</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://www.pythonmembers.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/markov2.png" /></p>
<p>now completed it looks like</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://www.pythonmembers.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/markov2-1.png" /></p>
<p>B P P R P P &hellip;</p>
<h2>matrix representation</h2>
<p>the above can also be written as</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://www.pythonmembers.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/markov_matrix_python.png" /></p>
<p>but whatever does that means?</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why we have state space to specify from where we begin</p>
<p><strong>state space {1 = rounder, 2 = burger, 3 = panini}</strong> </p>
<p>means we start first by rounder, then burger then panini</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://www.pythonmembers.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/markov_matrix_python2.png" /></p>
<h2>applying markov to text</h2>
<p>the idea is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>build a markov model</li>
<li>then to generate text through the model</li>
</ul>
<h3>rehearsal</h3>
<p>we&rsquo;ll have a program that scans every word and records the next word</p>
<p>let us take the text:</p>
<p><em>the meadow was green. the sun was shining. the boy went away. the glass was shining</em></p>
<p>tabulating next words we get:</p>
<p>the -&gt; meadow, sun, boy, glass</p>
<p>meadow -&gt; was</p>
<p>was -&gt; green, shining,shining</p>
<p>sun -&gt; was</p>
<p>boy -&gt; went</p>
<p>went -&gt; away</p>
<p>glass -&gt; was</p>
<p>from those we can generate the text</p>
<p>the sun was green</p>
<p>with path</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://www.pythonmembers.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sunwasgreenpy.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p>the meadow was shining</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://www.pythonmembers.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/meadowwasshiningpy.png" /></p>
<h3>wait, what about probabilities ?!</h3>
<p>well see</p>
<p>was -&gt; green, shining,shining </p>
<p>when we randomly choose from [ green, shining,shining ] we actually have more chance getting shining than green as they occur twice more, no need of writing up the probabilities. the only draw back is programming efficiency, which we&rsquo;ll clean up in another post</p>
<h2>the code</h2>
<pre><code class="language-python">
def format_text(file_read):
    # getting the data ready for generation
    data = {}
    lines = file_read.replace('\n', ' ').split('.')
    for line in lines:
        words = line.split()

        for i,word in enumerate(words):
            if i+1 &lt; len(words):
                next_word = words[i+1]

                if word not in data:
                    data[word] = [next_word]
                else:
                    data[word].append(next_word)
    return data

def rand(data):
    # chooses random element from dictionary
    return random.choice(list(data))

def generate(times, data):
    # specifies length of generated phrase
    current = rand(data)
    gens = [current]
    try:
        for i in range(times):
            current = random.choice(data[current])
            gens.append(current)
    except:
        pass
    return gens


with open('source.txt', 'r') as source:
    file = source.read()

data = format_text(file)

print(' '.join(generate(10, data)))

</code></pre>
<p>format text returns a dictionary. here is a snapshot:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">{
'is,': ['besides'], 
'unsupported': ['by'], 
'one': ['which', 'of', 'at', 'reason', 'proposition', 'form', 'of', 'which', 'thing', 'thing', 'magnitude', 'kind', 'of', 'relation', 'fact,', 'fact,', 'involving', 'case', 'of', 'kind', 'atomic', 'of', 'happens,', 'something', 'is', 'would'],
...

<p>i ran the program over some paragraphs of   </p>
<p><em>Our Knowledge of the External World as a Field for Scientific Method in Philosophy</em> </p>
<p>from</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mathematical logic, even in its most modern form, is not <em>directly</em> of<br />
 philosophical importance except in its beginnings. After &hellip;</p>

<p>to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Charles I. and death and his bed<br />
 are objective, but they are not, except in my thought, put together as<br />
 my false belief supposes. It is therefore necessary, in analysing a<br />
 belief, to look for some other logical form than a two-term relation.<br />
 Failure to realise this necessity has, in my opinion, vitiated almost<br />
 everything that has hitherto been written on the theory of knowledge,<br />
 making the problem of error insoluble and the difference between belief<br />
 and perception inexplicable.</p>
<p>Our Knowledge of the External World as a Field for Scientific Method in Philosophy <br />

<p>the core is here</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">    current = rand(data)
    gens = [current]
    try:
        for i in range(times):
            current = random.choice(data[current])
            gens.append(current)
    except:
        pass
    return gens

</code></pre>
<p>we start by adding a random word (a random element of the dictionary) to the list</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">current = rand(data)
gens = [current]

</code></pre>
<p>then we choose a random word from the words coming next</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://www.pythonmembers.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/explanation_markov_code.png" /></p>
<p>the code produces like</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://www.pythonmembers.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/markovgen1.png" /></p>

<h2>room for improvement</h2>
<p>well we can improve many things such as: first word first, choosing probabilities as numbers rather than from list, be sensitive to punctuations, improve context etc. a rough code lands up a pretty nice result</p>
