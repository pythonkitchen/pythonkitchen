                        <p>Here is my personal list of legally free Python books. <strong>Warning: Packt free books are highly unreliable, what can be free today can no longer be free tomorrow They were included as they are free at the time of writing this post. Similarly is Oreilly&rsquo;s case. The two publishing houses have been annotated as necessary.</strong> In case of no longer free or broken links please mail me at <code>arj.python at gmail dot com</code> to update article. I have to thank the internet who took the pain to point these resources to me. I have skimmed through the contents to producs a list of legally free Python books of value. Here&rsquo;s how i evaluated books (you might not agree, but that&rsquo;s my personal take on it):</p>
<p>Some popular listed books like Python Module of the Week is not a book and Tango with Django 1.7 is outdated. Materials which provide only some free chapters are not free books. Docs manuals are docs manuals, you&rsquo;d have to include a quarter of pypi&rsquo;s packages manuals then. github projects are gihub projects unless it&rsquo;s a book. Mark pilgrim ran away so should we from his book. We don&rsquo;t want some illegal 100+ free list (Mark Lutz books are not free mind you), you could include all Python books hosted on drive then. Python2 is past, we passed over. Fullstackpython&rsquo;s list is a collection of various sites&rsquo; articles, not a book. Really short books more qualified as leaflets did not make it. Such materials have been deliberately left out. What remains are books that you&rsquo;ll enjoy!</p>

<h3><a href="https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/intermediatepythongithubio/latest/intermediatepythongithubio.pdf">Intermediate Python</a></h3>
<p>Muhammad Yasoob Ullah Khalid </p>
<p>Python is an amazing language with a strong and friendly community of programmers. However, there is a lack of documentation on what to learn after getting the basics of Python down your throat. Through this book I aim to solve this problem. I would give you bits of information about some interesting topics which you can further explore. The topics which are discussed in this book open up your mind towards some nice corners of Python language. This book is an outcome of my desire to have something like this when I was beginning to learn Python. If you are a beginner, intermediate or even an advanced programmer there is something for you in this book. Please note that this book is not a tutorial and does not teach you Python. The topics are not explained in depth, instead only the minimum required information is given. A true example of legally free Python books. </p>
<h3><a href="http://ralsina.gitlab.io/boxes-book/">Boxes: Your Second Python Book</a></h3>
<p>Roberto Alcina</p>
<p>This book tries to achieve only one thing: Show you a project go from <strong>nothing</strong> to <strong>OK</strong>. By nothing I mean, no code at all. Not even a fleshed idea of what it does. No goals, no commitments. Just a vague interest. And by OK I mean it will work, it will have tests, it will be available to use, it will be <strong>useful</strong> and be a real thing. Think of it as a sort of documentary on the beginnings of a rock band, only instead of rockers there is a single overweight Argentinian dev, and instead of a band there is a piece of software. So, not much like a documentary on the beginnings of a rock band.</p>
<h3><a href="https://learnpythonbreakpython.com">Learn Python, Break Python</a></h3>
<p>Scott Grant</p>
<p>Learn Python, Break Python is a hands-on introduction to the Python programming language, written for people who have no experience with programming whatsoever. Hey, we all have to start somewhere. As such, the examples and teaching style used in this text make absolutely no expectations about your prior programming experience. Anyone can pick up the art of programming with a little time and a bit of patience. However, when learning something new, I try to break things. In fact, in many cases, I go out of my way to break stuff. When picking up a new concept like computer programming, you can actually increase your comfort level by figuring out the type of cases that are likely to break. You&rsquo;ll see what data can be used and where, and when you inevitably run into errors later (like everyone does), you won&rsquo;t be surprised.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~schneidj/PyBook/swan.pdf">Algorithmic Problem Solving with Python</a></h3>
<p>John B. Schneider, Shira Lynn Broschat, Jess Dahmen </p>
<p>(Not an algo book) Python&rsquo;s syntax and idioms are much easier to learn than those of most other full-featured languages. This book uses programming language Python to introduce folks to programming and algorithmic thinking. </p>
<h3><a href="https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/python-guide/latest/python-guide.pdf">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python.</a></h3>
<p>Kenneth Reitz</p>
<p>This opinionated guide exists to provide both novice and expert Python developers a best-practice handbook to the installation, configuration, and usage of Python on a daily basis. </p>
<h3><a href="https://www.slitherintopython.com">Slither Into Python</a></h3>
<p>Slither into Python is an introduction to Python for complete beginners. No prior programming experience or computer science background is necessary. Unlike any other Python resources I have found (not that they&rsquo;re not out there), they don&rsquo;t explain important computer science concepts such as memory or &ldquo;how computers work&rdquo;. In this book I will cover the fundamentals of the Python language and also introduce these important concepts. Put simply, <em>coding</em> or <em>computer programming</em> is about making computers do what you want, Computer Science is about <em>how</em> computers do it. Each go hand-in-hand, help you learn faster and improve your overall understanding of a language! This book aims to do exactly that through Python. </p>
<h3><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.pdf">A Whirlwind Tour of Python</a></h3>
<p>Jake VanderPlas - Oreilly</p>
<p>The book provides a whirlwind tour of some of Python’s essential syntax and semantics, built-in data types and structures, function definitions, control flow statements, and other aspects of the language. My aim is that readers will walk away with a solid foundation from which to explore the data science stack just outlined. </p>
<h3><a href="https://pymbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Python For You and Me</a></h3>
<p>Kushal Das (Core Dev)</p>
<p>A book for the total new comers into Python world. Was started as book for students before they read Python tutorial. Given it&rsquo;s from a core dev, even up to chapter choice order is insightful.</p>
<h3><a href="https://prappleizer.github.io/textbook.pdf">Python for Astronomers</a></h3>
<p>Imad Pasha, Christopher Agostino </p>
<p>This text is designed to be an introduction to the Python programming language — which is now used nearly ubiquitously in astronomy — with applications to the types of tasks an undergraduate (or beginning graduate student) might have to tackle. It is not, in any way, meant to be comprehensive; my focus is on bringing you up to speed as efficiently and quickly as possible. This text might have useful information for those with a working knowledge of Python outside of a research setting, but is primarily designed for those with no prior programming experience. By the end of this text, I hope to have shared enough to make you feel comfortable taking the first steps into research-type problems (of which this book will contain several examples), whether in an astronomy course, a research internship, or on-campus research. </p>
<h3><a href="https://leanpub.com/intermediatepython">OBI Intermediate Python</a></h3>
<p>Obi Ike-Nwosu </p>
<p>The python ecosystem is awash with books for beginners but few books target readers that are past the beginning stages but are not yet advanced users. The book aims to bridge that gap.

<h3><a href="https://assets.digitalocean.com/books/python/how-to-code-in-python.pdf">DigitalOcean eBook: How To Code in Python</a></h3>
<p>Lisa Tagliaferri </p>
<p>If you use the book in the order it is laid out, you’ll begin your exploration in Python by understanding the key differences between Python 3 and the previous versions of the language. From there, you’ll set up a programming environment for your relevant local or server-based system, and begin by learning general Python code structure, syntax, and data types. Along the way, you’ll gain a solid grounding in computational logic within Python, a set of skills relevant even when moving to other programming languages in the future. While the beginning of the book focuses on scripting in Python, object-oriented coding concepts are gradually introduced to help make your code more modular, flexible, and complex without repetition. By the end of the book, you’ll learn how to debug your Python code and finally how to port Python code across versions. </p>

<h3><a href="https://www.cosmicpython.com">Cosmic Python</a></h3>
<p>Harry Percival, Bob Gregory</p>
<p>Our aim with this book is to introduce several classic architectural patterns and show how they support TDD, DDD, and event-driven services. We hope it will serve as a reference for implementing them in a Pythonic way, and that people can use it as a first step toward further research in this field. Here are a few things we assume about you, dear reader: You’ve been close to some reasonably complex Python applications. You’ve seen some of the pain that comes with trying to manage that complexity. You don’t necessarily know anything about DDD or any of the classic application architecture patterns. </p>
<p>We structure our explorations of architectural patterns around an example app, building it up chapter by chapter. We use TDD at work, so we tend to show listings of tests first, followed by implementation. If you’re not used to working test-first, it may feel a little strange at the beginning, but we hope you’ll soon get used to seeing code &ldquo;being used&rdquo; (i.e., from the outside) before you see how it’s built on the inside. We use some specific Python frameworks and technologies, including Flask, SQLAlchemy, and pytest, as well as Docker and Redis. If you’re already familiar with them, that won’t hurt, but we don’t think it’s required. One of our main aims with this book is to build an architecture for which specific technology choices become minor implementation details. </p>
<h2>TDD</h2>

<h3><a href="http://greenteapress.com/complexity2/thinkcomplexity2.pdf">Think Complexity</a></h3>
<p>Allen Downey</p>
<p>Complexity Science is an interdisciplinary<br />
field—at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and natural science—that focuses on discrete models of physical and<br />
social systems. In particular, it focuses on complex systems, which are systems with many interacting components. <strong>Complex systems include networks and graphs, cellular automatons, agent-based models and swarms, fractals and self-organizing systems, chaotic systems and cybernetic systems</strong>. This book is primarily about complexity science, but studying complexity science gives you a chance to explore topics and ideas you might not encounter otherwise, practice programming in Python, and learn about data structures and algorithms. This book picks up where <em><a href="http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e">Think Python</a></em>leaves off.</p>
<h3><a href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkdast/thinkdast.pdf">Think Data Structures</a></h3>
<p>Allen Downey</p>
<p>Data structures and algorithms are among the most important inventions of the last 50 years, and they are fundamental tools software engineers need to know. But in my opinion, most of the books on these topics are too theoretical, too big, and too bottom-up. I try to alleviate the boredom by organizing the topics around an application—web search—that uses data structures extensively, and is an interesting and important topic in its own right.This application also motivates some topics that are not usually covered in an introductory data structures class, including persistent data structures, with Redis, and streaming algorithms.</p>

<h2>COMPUTER VISION</h2>
<h3><a href="http://programmingcomputervision.com/downloads/ProgrammingComputerVision_CCdraft.pdf">Programming Computer Vision with Python</a></h3>
<p>Jan Erik Solem - O&rsquo;Reilly</p>
<p>Cameras are everywhere. Computer vision powers applications like image search, robot navigation, medical image analysis, photo management and many more. This books provides easy hands-on computer vision with enough understanding of the underlying theory and algorithms to be a foundation for students, researchers and enthusiasts. Python comes with many freely available powerful modules for handling images, mathematical computing and data mining. In short this book aims to act as a source of inspiration for those interested in programming computer vision applications </p>
<h2>DATA SCIENCE</h2>

<p>Tom Augspurger</p>
<p>This series is about how to make effective use of pandas, a data analysis library for the Python programming language. It’s targeted at an intermediate level: people who have some experince with pandas, but are looking to improve. </p>
<h3><a href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/thinkstats2.pdf">Think Stats</a></h3>
<p>Allen Downey</p>
<p><em>Think Stats</em> is an introduction to Probability and Statistics for Python programmers. <em>Think Stats</em> emphasizes simple techniques you can use to explore real data sets and answer interesting questions. The book presents a case study using data from the National Institutes of Health. Readers are encouraged to work on a project with real datasets.</p>
<h3><a href="http://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/">Probabilistic Programming &amp; Bayesian Methods for Hackers</a></h3>
<p>Cam Davidson-Pilon </p>
<p>The Bayesian method is the natural approach to inference, yet it is hidden from readers behind chapters of slow, mathematical analysis. The typical text on Bayesian inference involves two to three chapters on probability theory, then enters what Bayesian inference is. Unfortunately, due to mathematical intractability of most Bayesian models, the reader is only shown simple, artificial examples. This can leave the user with a <em>so-what</em> feeling about Bayesian inference. <em>Bayesian Methods for Hackers</em> is designed as a introduction to Bayesian inference from a computational/understanding-first, and mathematics-second, point of view. For the mathematically trained, they may cure the curiosity this text generates with other texts designed with mathematical analysis in mind. For the enthusiast with less mathematical-background, or one who is not interested in the mathematics but simply the practice of Bayesian methods, this text should be sufficient and entertaining. A true example of legally free python books. </p>
<h3><a href="http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkbayes/thinkbayes.pdf">Think Bayes</a></h3>
<p>Allen Downey</p>
<p><em>Think Bayes</em> is an introduction to Bayesian statistics using computational methods. Most books on Bayesian statistics use mathematical notation and present ideas in terms of mathematical concepts like calculus. This book uses Python code instead of math, and discrete approximations instead of continuous mathematics. As a result, what would be an integral in a math book becomes a summation, and most operations on probability distributions are simple loops. I think this presentation is easier to understand, at least for people with programming skills. It is also more general, because when we make modeling decisions, we can choose the most appropriate model without worrying too much about whether the model lends itself to conventional analysis. Also, it provides a smooth development path from simple examples to real-world problems.</p>
<h3><a href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkdsp/thinkdsp.pdf">Digital Signal Processing in Python (Think DSP)</a></h3>
<p>Allen Downey</p>
<p><em>Think DSP</em> is an introduction to Digital Signal Processing in Python. The premise of this book (and the other books in the <em>Think X</em> series) is that if you know how to program, you can use that skill to learn other things. I am writing this book because I think the conventional approach to digital signal processing is backward: most books (and the classes that use them) present the material bottom-up, starting with mathematical abstractions like phasors. With a programming-based approach, I can go top-down, which means I can present the most important ideas right away. By the end of the first chapter, you can decompose a sound into its harmonics, modify the harmonics, and generate new sounds.</p>

<h3><a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/">Python Data Science Handbook</a></h3>
<p>Jake VanderPlas</p>
<p>This is a book about doing data science with Python. The book is not meant to be an introduction to Python or to programming in general; I assume the reader has familiarity with the Python language, including defining functions, assigning variables, calling methods of objects, controlling the flow of a program, and other basic tasks. Instead it is meant to help Python users learn to use Python&rsquo;s data science stack–libraries such as IPython, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and related tools–to effectively store, manipulate, and gain insight from data. A true example of legally free Python books. </p>
<h2>VISUALISATIONS-FOCUSED</h2>
<h3><a href="https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/python-opengl/">Python &amp; OpenGL for Scientific Visualization</a></h3>
<p>Nicolas Rougier</p>
<p><strong>Python and OpenGL</strong> have a long but complicated story. It used to be really easy to program something using the fixed-pipeline and libraries such as Pyglet. But, things have became more difficult with the introduction of the dynamic graphic pipeline in 2004. Therefore this book is reconciles Python programmers with OpenGL, providing both an introduction to modern OpenGL and a set of basic and advanced techniques in order to achieve both fast, scalable &amp; beautiful scientific visualizations. The book uses the GLES 2.0 API. Though it does not cover up-to-date OpenGL techniques, it is sufficient to achieve great visualisation. Modern OpenGL allows to control much in the pipeline and this book explains several techniques such as isolines, markers, colormaps, arbitrary transformations but there are actually many more techniques to be discovered. And of course, everything will be fast and beautiful. A true example of legally free python books. </p>

<h3><a href="http://www.nltk.org/book/">Natural Language Processing with Python</a></h3>
<p>Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, Edward Loper</p>
<p>This is a book about Natural Language Processing. By &ldquo;natural language&rdquo; we mean a language that is used for everyday communication by humans; languages like English, Hindi or Portuguese. In contrast to artificial languages such as programming languages and mathematical notations, natural languages have evolved as they pass from generation to generation, and are hard to pin down with explicit rules. We will take Natural Language Processing — or NLP for short — in a wide sense to cover any kind of computer manipulation of natural language. At one extreme, it could be as simple as counting word frequencies to compare different writing styles. At the other extreme, NLP involves &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; complete human utterances, at least to the extent of being able to give useful responses to them.

<p>Robert Johansson </p>
<p>Science has traditionally been divided into experimental and theoretical disciplines, but during the last several decades computing has emerged as a very important part of science. Scientific computing is often closely related to theory, but it also has many characteristics in common with experimental work. It is therefore often viewed as a new third branch of science. In most fields of science, computational work is an important complement to both experiments and theory, and nowadays a vast majority of both experimental and theoretical papers involve some numerical calculations, simulations or computer modeling. </p>
