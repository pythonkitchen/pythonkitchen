![automate the boring stuff in python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/images/automate_small_cover.png)

it is free to read [here](https://automatetheboringstuff.com)

it is a renowned book in the python world

it teaches some intro before moving on to apps

it is notÂ  a complete beginner book

the use of 3rd party libs is duly highlighted

the approach to program designing is good

if you completed all the projects in the book then you've gained an insane amount of experience at the beginning itself!
