Hi folks, an announcement! 




It's a bit sad to see that PySide Docs are actually Qt examples. The name is cut off from the scene. We've started a project devoted to Pyside docs at [pythonmembers.club/pyside](https://www.pythonmembers.club/pyside/).




We intend to write self-contained snippets to help people out!




Mail arj dot python at gmail dot com if you want to contribute!
