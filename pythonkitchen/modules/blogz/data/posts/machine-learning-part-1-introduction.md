**what is it?**
---------------




wikipaedia defines machine learning as:




\_the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to progressively improve their performance ðŸ“ˆ on a specific task. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model of sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task\_




data -> train -> do tasks




**relationship with data science**
----------------------------------




since data is used, it should be cleaned etc. knowing what data to collect, how etc, also about formulas needed, is part of data science




**relationship with statistics**
--------------------------------




![]()


machine learning is 100% applied maths, more specifically, statistics :bar\_chart: plays a very important part. a computer is there to calculate and repeat faster




**use of machine learning**
---------------------------




image recognition like recognising digits and letters from pictures, books recommendations on some sites, criminal identification on anonymous networks, speech recognition etc.




**types of machine learning**
-----------------------------




â™¡ supervised learning  
â™¡ unsupervised learning  
â™¡ reinforcement learning
