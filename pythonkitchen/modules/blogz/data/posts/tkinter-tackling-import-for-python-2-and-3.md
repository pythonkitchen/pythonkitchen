tkinter is the integrated GUIÂ package in python. It has had an import naming change in python 3. This is the main hindrance in making tkinter codes run on python 3 or vice versa. fortunately the fix is a simple one
Some syntax
-----------


in python 2 we imported as :

```python

import Tkinter


```

and in python 3 we import as :

```python

import tkinter


```

notice the T in py2
The fix
-------


Here is a tip for cross platforming :

```python
try:
 import tkinter
except ImportError:
 import Tkinter

```

What it does
------------


it imports the py3 version, if ok, it continues if no ... it imports the python2 version, simple !
